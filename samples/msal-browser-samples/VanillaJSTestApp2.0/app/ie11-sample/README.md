# IE11/Edge Browser Compatibility Considerations
In order to properly support IE11 there are a few things to keep in mind:
- Your app will need to provide a Promise polyfill, such as Bluebird
- We recommend using Redirect flows as there are situations where popups are blocked
- We recommend setting `storeAuthStateInCookie` to true in your `msalConfig.cache` to prevent looping issues
- Ensure your app and `login.microsoftonline.com` are both added as Trusted Sites in the same Security Zone
