The MSAL library preview for JavaScript is the core library which enables JavaScript web applications to authenticate enterprise users using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD), Microsoft account users (MSA), users using social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn etc. and get access to [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) OR  [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).

## Important Note about the MSAL Preview
This library is suitable for use in a production environment. We provide the same production level support for this library as we do our current production libraries. During the preview we may make changes to the API, internal cache format, and other mechanisms of this library, which you will be required to take along with bug fixes or feature improvements. This may impact your application. For instance, a change to the cache format may impact your users, such as requiring them to sign in again. An API change may require you to update your code. When we provide the General Availability release we will require you to update to the General Availability version within six months, as applications written using a preview version of library may no longer work.

## Installation
Via NPM:

    npm install msal

Via CDN:

    <!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
    <script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/<version>/js/msal.js"></script>
    <script src="https://secure.aadcdn.microsoftonline-p.com/lib/<version>/js/msal.min.js"></script>

Note that msal.js is built for ES5, therefore enabling support for Internet Explorer 11. If you want to target Internet Explorer, you'll need to add a reference to promises polyfill.

    <!-- IE support: add promises polyfill before msal.js  -->
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bluebird/3.3.4/bluebird.min.js" class="pre"></script>


## Usage
The example snippets below show how to acquire a token for Microsoft Graph.

#### Prerequisite

Before using MSAL, register an application in Azure AD v2.0 using the [application registration portal](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com/) to get your clientID. As part of the registration, you will also need to add the Web platform, check the "Implicit Flow" checkbox, and add the redirectURI to your application.

#### 1. Instantiate the UserAgentApplication

Instantiate the UserAgentApplication with a clientID and callback that is called after the authentication request is complete.

UserAgentApplication has other optional parameters like redirectUri which can be assigned. Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/wiki/MSAL-basics#configuration-options) to see the full list and their default values.

```JavaScript
    var applicationConfig = {
        clientID: 'your_client_id'
    };

     var userAgentApplication = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(applicationConfig.clientID, null, authCallback);

    function authCallback(errorDesc, token, error, tokenType) {
        if (token) {
        }
        else {
            log(error + ":" + errorDesc);
        }
    }
```

#### 2. Login the user and then get an access token

Your app must login the user with either loginPopup or the loginRedirect method to establish user context. Next, you can get access tokens for the APIs your app needs to call using the acquireTokenSilent method. If the silent token acquisition fails for some reasons such as expiration, you will need to invoke an interactive method to acquire tokens.

 ```JavaScript
    var graphScopes = ["user.read", "mail.send"];

    userAgentApplication.loginPopup(graphScopes).then(function (idToken) {
        //Login Success
        userAgentApplication.acquireTokenSilent(graphScopes).then(function (accessToken) {
            //AcquireTokenSilent Success
        }, function (error) {
            //AcquireTokenSilent Failure, send an interactive request.
            userAgentApplication.acquireTokenPopup(graphScopes).then(function (accessToken) {
                updateUI();
            }, function (error) {
                console.log(error);
            });
        })
    }, function (error) {
        console.log(error);
    });
```

#### 3. Use the token as a bearer in an HTTP request to call the Microsoft Graph or a Web API

```JavaScript
    var headers = new Headers();
    var bearer = "Bearer " + token;
    headers.append("Authorization", bearer);
    var options = {
         method: "GET",
         headers: headers
    };
    var graphEndpoint = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me";

    fetch(graphEndpoint, options)
        .then(function (response) {
             //do something with response
        }
```

## Contribute

We enthusiastically welcome contributions and feedback. Please read the [contributing guide](contributing.md) before you begin.

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.
