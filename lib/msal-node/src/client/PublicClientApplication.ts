     * If your application supports Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with common.
     * To restrict support to Personal Microsoft accounts only, replace "Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here" value with consumers.
     *
     * In Azure B2C, authority is of the form https://{instance}/tfp/{tenant}/{policyName}/
