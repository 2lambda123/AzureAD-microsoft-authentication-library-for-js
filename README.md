
Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (MSAL.js)
=========================================================

| [Getting Started](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2)| [Docs](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2) | [API Reference](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js/dev/doc/index.html) | [Support](README.md#community-help-and-support) | [Sample](./devApps/VanillaJSTestApp )

The MSAL library for JavaScript enables your app to authorize enterprise users using Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AAD), Microsoft account users (MSA), users using social identity providers like Facebook, Google, LinkedIn etc.. and get access to [Microsoft Cloud](https://cloud.microsoft.com) OR  [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io).

The identity management services that the library interacts with are [Microsoft Azure Active Directoryy](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/), [Microsoft Azure B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-b2c/) and [Microsoft Accounts](https://account.microsoft.com).

MSAL for Javascript is in active development, but not yet ready. We encourage you to look at our work in progress and provide feedback!
**It should not be used in production environments.**

## Example

```JavaScript
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bluebird/3.3.4/bluebird.min.js" class="pre"></script>

    <script class="pre">
        var userAgentApplication = new Msal.UserAgentApplication("your_client_id", null, function (errorDes, token, error, tokenType) {
              // this callback is called after loginRedirect OR acquireTokenRedirect
        })
        userAgentApplication.loginPopup("user.read").then( function(token) {
            var user = userAgentApplication.getUser();
            if (user) {
               // signin successful
            } else {
               // signin failure
            }
        }, function (error) {
            //handle error
        });
          // get an access token
          userAgentApplication.acquireTokenSilent("user.read").then(function (token) {
            console.log("ATS promise resolved");
          }, function (error) {
            // interaction required 
            if(error.indexOf("interaction_required" != -1) {
                userAgentApplication.acquireTokenPopup("mail.send").then(function (token) {
                // success
              }, function (error) {
                // error

## Security Library

This library controls how users sign-in and access services. We recommend you always take the latest version of our library in your app when possible. We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org) so you can control the risk associated with updating your app. As an example, always downloading the latest minor version number (e.g. x.*y*.x) ensures you get the latest security and feature enhanements but our API surface remains the same. You can always see the latest version and release notes under the Releases tab of GitHub.

## Security Reporting

If you find a security issue with our libraries or services please report it to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com) with as much detail as possible. Your submission may be eligible for a bounty through the [Microsoft Bounty](http://aka.ms/bugbounty) program. Please do not post security issues to GitHub Issues or any other public site. We will contact you shortly upon receiving the information. We encourage you to get notifications of when security incidents occur by visiting [this page](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/dd252948) and subscribing to Security Advisory Alerts.
